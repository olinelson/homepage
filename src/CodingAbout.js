        <p>
          Full stack web developer with a passion for innovation and efficiency.
          With experience in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, React and a background
          in music, I discovered web development through intense personal
          curiosity that then motivated me to seek accredited training with the
          Flatiron school. I bring strong skills in project management, problem
          solving and creativity that help innovative companies to create
          efficient and effective products. As an established musician, I am
          very comfortable as a self-directed learner and I understand the long
          term benefits of practice, patience and persistence when building
          skills and developing unique products.

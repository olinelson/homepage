      <p>
        Full stack web developer with a passion for innovation and efficiency.
        With experience in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, React and a background in
        music, I discovered web development through intense personal curiosity
        that then motivated me to seek accredited training with the Flatiron
        school. I bring strong skills in project management, problem solving and
        creativity that help innovative companies to create efficient and
        effective products. As an established musician, I am very comfortable as
        a self-directed learner and I understand the long term benefits of
        practice, patience and persistence when building skills and developing
        unique products.<a className="resume-link" href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1--AjndSnU3yztOyNebUBDgXGvodAWFGYgK6zKJV3xyg/edit?usp=sharing">Click here to view resum√©.</a>
